## Introduction
### Scenario
"You are a junior data analyst working on the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share
company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the companyâ€™s future success
depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your team wants to
understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these
insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual
members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be
backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations."
